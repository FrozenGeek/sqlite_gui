### What is OpenRVDAS

### OpenRVDAS Sqlite GUI
OK... if you've arrived here, you're out on the bleeding edge.
The idea with this repo (which is basically just freshly extracted from 
the sqlite_gui bit of FrozenGeek/OpenRVDAS) is that you install openrvdas from 
oceandatatools, then somewhere else you install this.  Then
you create a symlink in the top level openrvdas directory pointing to this
directory.

Am I explaining that right?  I'll work on that.  For now, I'm going to
try using this with a clean install.  And for now, you probably shouldn't
be trying to use this.  But if you're interested, keep an eye on this
project (and this README file).
